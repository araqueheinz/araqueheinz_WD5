The Theory Behind Authentication

•	What it really means to be authenticated and why we care about authentication at all?

1st   Thing we have to know is that HTTP is stateless. Remember we communicate between our browser and our Express web server by HTTP Request. 

What stateless means is that between 2 given requests that we make HTTP inherently has no way to identify or share information between 2 separate requests. 

In other words if we make another request followed by the log me in request, the server won’t know who we are. 

That’s because be default information is no shared. 

•	How do we solve it?

By authenticating with the server, sends a token back that identifies the user.
This token is used in every other request.
The server recognized the token, therefore recognizes the user allowing them to get the information they want. 

We are going to use cookie-based authentication.  That means that when we get some initial request like our Express API to log in we are going to generate a piece of information that is going to be sent back to the browser from the sever: 

We are going to include what is called a header inside of the response that gets sent back to the browser! 

All we care about what we receive from GoogleOAuth is the google user Id, that we are going to use to recognize the user's data!
