Mongoose is a JS library that provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your 
application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic 
hooks and more, out of the box.

In the Mongoose library we make use of something called model class. a model class represents an
entire Mongo db collection. A model class has a bunch of functions attached to it that are design 
to work with an entire collection.

Model class represents an entire collection
Model instances each represents on individual record.
