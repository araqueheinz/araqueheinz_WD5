In case your laptop gets stolen or you lost
it, you need to store your keys somewhere where 
they are going to be secure.

We are going to create two sets of keys 
that means two different mongodb databases

The development database that we test, add, edit and 
delete as we see fit and the Production database that 
we set and don't touch ever again. 

go to mlab.com and create another database
create an administrator user different from
the dev databases 

go to https://console.developers.google.com and create a 
separate project AraqueHeinz-WD5-prod. Go to the same process
create credentials this time we are going to use the heroku url

for Authorized Javascript Origin:

https://stormy-headland-31614.herokuapp.com (Remember no / at the end)

This is going to be our Authorized Redirect URI
    https://stormy-headland-31614.herokuapp.com/auth/google/callback

    "REMEMBER" this is the url given by heroku + /auth/google/callback the 
    extension is going after going through the google server

Done!

We are going to create two new file inside the config folder
dev.js and prod.js
the keys.js is going to decide wether to pull the keys for development
or Production

in prod.js we are going to call the key values from something calle "environment 
variables" using heroku. 

the dev.js is going to be ignored and not commited to github however we do want to 
commit the keys.js.

Set up heroku

    we are going to set up all the environment variables in heroku!

    go to https://www.heroku.com

    look for the app you're working on and click on it. 

    go to settings --> reveal config variables.

    ADD the keys and their value example:
        COOKIE_KEY  lksndjksandjs

    now lets do deployment, in terminal 
    git add .
    git commit -m 'message'
    git push heroku master
